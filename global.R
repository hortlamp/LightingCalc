Greenhouse light transmission typically ranges from 40%-90%. If you have a light meter, you can check this for your own greenhouse, preferably on a sunny day, around noon, when light levels are steady: measure light inside and outside of the greenhouse and calculate transmission as light in the (greenhouse/light outside the greenhouse) x 100%. The transmission of your greenhouse as a whole is lower than the transmission of the glazing material. For accurate results, you need to use the greenhouse transmission, not the glazing material transmission.
